## Hi, I’m @CharlieBluu

I'm currently learning computer science fundamentals and C programming through Harvard's CS50 course.

## What I'm working on
- C programming (arrays, loops, conditionals, funcitons)
- Problem solving and debugging
- Understanding how things work under the hood

## Current projects
- CS50 problem sets (credit card validation, readability, games, etc.)
- Small exercises to practice core concepts

## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in computer science
- Learn data structures and algorithms
- Transition into a software developer role

This GitHub documents my learning journey, including mistakes, experiments, and improvements over time.
